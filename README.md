# electric-plan
Django and Flask app to help plan electricity use in NW England

# master
this branch holds a working Flask app to render the latest chart

pythonanywhere directory for this branch is /home/anw/mysite/electric-plan
The other dirs are mostly artefacts of history

# justchart
this branch holds the original Django app and renders a similar plotly chart

TO DO : Change template files to instantiate class from live_data_collect rather than copy it
