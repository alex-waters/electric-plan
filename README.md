# electric-plan
This repo holds both Django and Flask apps to help plan electricity use to minimise carbon emissions

TO DO:
Change template files to instantiate class from live_data_collect rather than copy it

## master
this branch holds a working Flask app to render the latest chart

pythonanywhere directory for this branch is /home/anw/mysite/electric-plan
The other dirs are mostly artefacts of history

## justchart
this branch holds the original Django app and renders a similar plotly chart

## api-module
this branch holds the original Django app and displays the data in text as a list
